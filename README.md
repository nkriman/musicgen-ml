# Music Analysis and Prediction Using Transformers

## Project Overview

This project is at the ideation stage and aims to explore the use of transformer architectures for analyzing and predicting musical patterns. The goal is to create a model that can predict the next bar of music based on the previous context, focusing on a specific genre and BPM range.

## Objectives

- To define and extract meaningful 'semantic tokens' from music akin to words in text.
- To develop a method for creating embeddings for these musical tokens.
- To use these embeddings to train a transformer model for music prediction.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Normalize the loudness of music tracks.
- Detect and segment music into bars based on BPM.
- Define and extract features for semantic tokens.

### Feature Extraction

- Explore various audio feature extraction techniques, such as MFCCs, Chroma features, and rhythm patterns.
- Aggregate these features into a vector representation for each semantic token.

### Model Training

- Train a transformer model on sequences of these embeddings.
- Experiment with different architectures and parameters to optimize performance.

### Evaluation

- Evaluate the embeddings' effectiveness in capturing musical patterns.
- Test the model's ability to predict the next bar of music accurately.

## Current Status

- The project is currently in the conceptualization phase.
- Ideas and methodologies are being explored and refined.
